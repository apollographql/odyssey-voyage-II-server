# FINAL CODE - Airlock (Server) - Odyssey Federation Part 2 App

This is the final state of the codebase after going through the Odyssey course.

Welcome to the companion app (server) of Odyssey's Federation Part 2 Course! You can [find the course lessons and instructions on Odyssey](http://odyssey.apollographql.com), Apollo's learning platform.

You can [preview the completed demo app here](http://odyssey.apollographql.com).

You can [find the client counterpart here](http://odyssey.apollographql.com).

## How to use this repo

The course will walk you through step by step how to turn this monolithic graph into a federated graph. This codebase is the starting point of your journey!

To get started:

1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start`.

This will start the GraphQL API server on localhost:4000.

Next, let's run some local services.

1. In a new terminal window, run `npm run launch`. This will run 3 local services, which you can learn about in the accompanying Odyssey course.

### Resetting the database

After playing around with the data, you may want to reset to its initial state. To do this, run `npm run db:reset`.
